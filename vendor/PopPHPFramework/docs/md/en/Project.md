The Project component contains the Project class in which you can extend and encapsulate your application's specifications, such as the router, controllers, databases and modules. Once, set up properly, the project can run and successfully route the user's request to the correct area of your application.

Also, the Project component contains the install classes that the CLI component uses to build and install your project scaffolding.
