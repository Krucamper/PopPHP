Documentation : File
--------------------

The File component provides a useful API to manage and manipulate files on disk. It also provides the functionality to easily manage file uploads.

<pre>
use Pop\File\File;

// Create a new file and write to it.
$file = new File('new-file.txt');
$file->write('Some text to the file.')
     ->save();

// Upload a file from a multipart POST form.
$upload = File::upload($_FILES['upload_file']['tmp_name'], '../uploads/' . $_FILES['upload_file']['name']);
echo 'File uploaded.';
</pre>
