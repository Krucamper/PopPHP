Documentation : Payment
-----------------------

The Payment component provides standardized functionality to process credit card payment requests via a 3rd party gateway.  The current built-in and supported gateways are:

* Authorize.net
* PayLeap
* PayPal
* TrustCommerce
* UsaEpay

However, if support for a different gateway is required, then it would simple to just write an adapter for it.
