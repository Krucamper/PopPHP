Documentation : Auth
--------------------

The Auth component facilitates authentication and authorization of users based on a basic set of credentials and defined roles. The authentication aspect handles authenticating a user to determine whether or not that user is allowed at all. The authorization aspect handles determining whether or not the authenticated user has enough access to be allowed within a certain area. Roles can easily be defined and evaluated to determine a user's level of access. The Auth component can easily tie into a database table or a file on disk to retrieve user credentials and information.
