Documentation : Graph
---------------------

The Graph component allows for robust graphing functionality that can utilize any of the built in graphic components such as Image, Svg and Pdf to draw graphs in a variety of formats. You can define a wide array of graphic attributes to create and render line graphs, bar graphs and pie charts. Since the API among the different graphic components is standardized, it's very easy to interchange amongst different the file and image formats in which to produce a graph.
