INSTALLATION
------------

The Pop PHP Framework requires no special installation steps. Simply download the
framework and extract it next to or inside of your document root. If you change
the relationship of the 'bootstrap.php' file to the location of the 'library'
folder, you'll have to make that adjustment in the 'require_once' statement in
the 'bootstrap.php' file.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Please see README.TXT.


DEVELOPMENT VERSIONS
--------------------

The Pop PHP Framework is available for anonymous checkout via
GitHub at https://github.com/nicksagona/PopPHP
