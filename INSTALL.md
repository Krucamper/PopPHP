INSTALLATION
============

The Pop PHP Framework requires no special installation steps. Simply
download the framework and extract it. If you change the relationship
of the 'bootstrap.php' file to the location of the 'vendor' folder,
you'll have to make that adjustment in the 'require_once' statement
in the 'bootstrap.php' file.
