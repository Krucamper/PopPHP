Project build complete.
This process will build a lightweight framework for your project under the 'module/ProjectName' folder. Minimally, you should have the 'config/project.build.php' file present, which should return an array containing your project build settings, such as your database information and credentials. Besides creating the folders and files for you, one of the main benefits is ability to test and install the database and the corresponding configuration and class files. You can do this by having the SQL files in the 'config/dbname' folder. The following folder structure is required for the database installation to work properly:
Build a project based on the files in the 'config' folder
Check the current configuration for required dependencies
Display this help
Display build project instructions
Set the default language for the project
Create a class map file from the source folder and save to the output file
